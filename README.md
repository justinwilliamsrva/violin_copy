Project 2:  
Violin-Central

Group Name: 
The Richmond Virtuosi


Description:
They say time is money; @violincentral.com we are dedicated to enabling the user to search through hundreds of violin technical books with the click of a button.  This application will be a vital resource for violin teachers. It will allow the user to search for violin exercises (lessons) that match criteria for student learning objectives and outcomes.  This will enable the user (teacher/instructor) to efficiently and accurately locate a plethera of resources that will ensure their  student's receive meaningful and varied violin activities.  This program will access lessons based on positions (main/secondary), bowing technique (main/secondary), keys, and difficulty level (beginner through expert).  This application does not stop there.  Teachers can also post lessons plans for others to use as well as use it as a platform to promote their personal brand and style of instruction.
